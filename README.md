# Generative-AI
- Install the necessary libraries from requirements.txt using "pip" command
- A retriever is an interface that returns documents given an unstructured query. It is more general than a vector store. A retriever does not need to be able to store documents, only to return (or retrieve) them. Vector stores can be used as the backbone of a retriever, but there are other types of retrievers as well.
- This project needs LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) in addition to retrievers
- Store the necessary api keys in .env file
